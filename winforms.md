# GUIs based on Windows Forms (WinForms)

*WinForms* (or *WinForms* for short) is the name for the classes in the namespace *Syxstem.Windows.Forms* that allow the creation of more or less sophisticated graphical user interfaces for .Net desktop applicatations on Windows.

*WinForms* does **NOT** work on *Linux*, *MacOS* etc.

It can be used for PowerShell scripts very easily, but again **Windows only**.

Although *PowerShell 7* can be used on many platforms, unfortunately this does not include the Windows specific "ingredients" like WinForms (or WMI).
